// You are tasked with writing a function whoIsBanished(votes) where:

// 'votes' is an array of objects. Each object represents a player and their vote count:
// { name: 'Alice', votes: 3 }
// The function determines the player with the most votes. This player is then banished! So your function should then return the player name, and how many votes they have.

// If there is a tie (two or more players with the highest vote count), the first player (in order of appearance) among the tied players is banished.
// The function should return the name of the banished player, if there are no players with any votes then the function should return null.

// REMEMBER: Install vitest by typing: npm install vitest (into your console)

export function whoIsBanished(votes) {
    //Your answer here
}
